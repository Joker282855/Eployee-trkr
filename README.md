# Title:
Employee Tracker

# Description: 
The goal of this challenge was to connect to a sql database and then use the inquirer package along with the console.table package to show the database in the console. We had to build the applicaiton up from scratch without any starter code.

# Assignment Tasks:
1. When the application starts the inquirer package initiates and gives the user the options to view all departments, view all employees, view all roles, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and upadate an employee.
2. When the client chooses to view all departments then the department table shows up in the console
3. When the client chooses to view all roles then the role table shows up on the console
4. When the client chooses to view all employees then the employee table shows up in the console
5. When the client chooses to add a department the department table shows up in the console with the new client appearing in the table
6. When the client chooses to add a a role the new role appears in the table after the table gets pritned to the console
7. When the client chooses to add an employee the updated informaiton appears in the employee table/database when it appears in the command line

# Information Used To Do Tasks:
I reveiwed the module 12 lesson and looked up the documentation for the console.table package on web mdn docs. 

# Future Development:
What I need to work on for the future development of this challenge is connecting the actual database to the console.table package. To do this I am going to improve my google fu skills and find examples that can help me understand how to connect inquirer with console.table. The other way I can imporve this application is modifying the inquirer code to make it so the user input that makes the tables show up does not have to be hardcoded
